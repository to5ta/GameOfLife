## Tests

## Ideas

* ~~Slider for simulation speed~~
* Load / save function + menu
* Predefined pattern placement, select from menu + click to place
* Game settings for resizing the field and toggle border behaviour
* Step forwards / backwards using memento Pattern  
* Render image sequences from the simulation
